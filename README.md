# Google-Earth-Engine-Apps

This Google Earth Engine (GEE) project is an interactive web application for analyzing Land Use Land Cover (LULC) patterns and rainfall trends over selected regions. Users can visualize LULC classifications with distinct color codes and compute the area of each land cover class in hectares. The app also enables users to generate IMD rainfall time-series charts for a chosen time period, helping in the analysis of temporal rainfall variations. An intuitive UI with dropdowns, legends, and data panels enhances usability, making spatial and temporal data interpretation seamless.
